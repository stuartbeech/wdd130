        Hello! My name is Stuart Beech and I am from Johannesburg, South Africa.
        In my free time, I enjoy playing indoor cricket, collecting LEGO sets,
        and spending time in my garden. I am currently working full-time while
        pursuing a BASc degree in Software Development.

      <p>
        South Africa is a stunning and diverse country at the southern tip of
        Africa, known for its rich cultural heritage and breathtaking
        landscapes. It's famous for the "Big Five" ‚Äì lions, leopards, elephants,
        rhinos, and buffaloes ‚Äì which can be seen in national parks like Kruger.
        The country offers a mix of vibrant cities, such as Cape Town and
        Johannesburg, and natural wonders like Table Mountain and its beautiful
        beaches. With its unique blend of wildlife, history, and modern
        attractions, South Africa is a top destination for adventure and
        exploration.
